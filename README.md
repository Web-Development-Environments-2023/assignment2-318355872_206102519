Welcome to the README file for our HTML5 game! This file contains important information that will help you understand how to play the game and get the most out of your experience.

Game Description:
Our HTML5 game is a puzzle game that requires you to match colored gems to score points. The game consists of a game board with different colored gems, and your goal is to swap adjacent gems to create a chain of three or more matching gems in a row or column. The more gems you match, the higher your score!

Game Controls:
To play the game, you can use your mouse or touchscreen. To swap adjacent gems, simply click on one gem and then click on an adjacent gem to swap their positions. If the swap creates a chain of three or more matching gems, they will disappear, and you will score points. You can also use the keyboard arrow keys to move the cursor around the board and the space bar or enter key to swap gems.

Game Rules:
In order to win the game, you must achieve a target score within a specified number of moves. Each level has a different target score and move limit. As you progress through the levels, the game becomes more challenging with new obstacles and bonuses to keep you engaged.
